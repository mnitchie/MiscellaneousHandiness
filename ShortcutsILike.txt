cmd+shift+arrow - change terminal tabs
cmd+numpad ‘plus’ - expand folded collection
cmd+numpad ‘minus’ - collapse folded collection
ctrl+option+up or down - next or previous member
cmd+o twice (show inherited members as well as direct members
cmd+t - go to super type or subtype
cmd+e - navigate open editors
ctrl+option+h - open call hierarchy
f4 - open type hierarchy
